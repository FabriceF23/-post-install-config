After you install osTicket, here's how to make it work for your team. <h2>Tools and Technologies Used</h2> - **Microsoft Azure** (this is where we set up virtual machines to run osTicket) - **Remote Desktop** (a way to control another computer from far away) - **Internet Information Services (IIS)** (helps run websites) <h2>Operating System</h2> - **Windows 10** (version 21H2) <h2>Setup Goals</h2> Here’s what we wanted to set up after installing osTicket: - Create roles with different permissions for users (like who can do what). - Make departments so tickets are easier to organize. - Set up teams for specific tasks. - Allow anyone (customers) to submit tickets. - Set up agents (people who help customers), users (customers), service levels (how fast we respond), and help topics (the categories of tickets). <h2>Step-by-Step Setup</h2> <p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fOmiEF3.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="Configuring roles and permissions"/> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CpzZXAy.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="Creating departments and roles"/> </p> <p> First, I logged into the admin area of osTicket (the control panel) from the Windows Virtual Machine we set up. I created a new role called **"Supreme Admin"** with full permissions. This means they can assign tickets, close them, delete, or change them. I also made a department called **"SysAdmins"** and made it the top department in the system. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aNqVwOh.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Creating teams and agents"/> </p> <p> Then, I set up some teams in the **Agents** section. For example, I created a team for **"Online Banking"**. I also turned on a setting so that users (customers) could create tickets by registering and logging into the system. After that, I created two agents: one for the **"SysAdmins"** department and one for the **"Support"** department. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9FrYNyx.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Creating user accounts"/> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/K6Flk2m.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting up SLAs and help topics"/> </p> <p> I created two test users, **Karen** and **Ken**, to act as customers. I went to the **Agent** panel to make their accounts. Then, I went back to the Admin panel and set up **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**. These are just rules about how fast we’ll respond to different types of issues. Here’s what I set up: - **Sev-A**: We’ll respond within 1 hour, anytime (24/7). - **Sev-B**: We’ll respond within 4 hours, anytime (24/7). - **Sev-C**: We’ll respond within 8 hours, available most of the time (25/7 – meaning almost always except a very short time). </p> <br /> <p> Lastly, I created different **Help Topics** to help organize the tickets. These are things like: - **Business Critical Outage** (when something important goes wrong) - **Personal Computer Issues** - **Equipment Request** (asking for new equipment) - **Password Reset** - **Other** (for anything else that doesn’t fit) </p>
